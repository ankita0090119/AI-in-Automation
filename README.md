 Leveraging AI in Automation for Enhanced Decision-Making in Supply Chain Management 
The theme chosen is "AI in Automation," and the problem we wish to address is how to optimize supply chain management using artificial intelligence. Traditional supply chain processes involve complex decision-making, such as inventory management,  demand forecasting, and logistics optimization. The goal is to develop an innovative AI-driven system that can analyze vast amounts of real-time data, historical trends, and external factors to make data-driven decisions autonomously. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, we aim to streamline operations, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance overall supply chain resilience and adaptability. This research has the potential to revolutionize supply chain management across industries and lead to practical implementations with far-reaching benefits.
